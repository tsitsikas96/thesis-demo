# Thesis Demo

This repository contains source code and build files for my master thesis with title 
**Using Containers in Cyber-Physical Systems: From Mass Production to Mass Customization**.

In this thesis, Containers technology was studied as a tool for converting a mass production
system into a mass customization system and the Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol as a
means of communication and management of the subsystems.

This demo was developed and deployed in GOCAS system. More information about the system can
be found [here]. The system uses 5 Rasberry Pi Mode 3 B+.

## Tech

* [Docker] - Most famous tool for Containers management
* Java
* Python
* [Leshan LWM2M] - Java implementation of OMA LWM2M Application Protocol
* [Docker SDK for Python] - A Python library for the Docker Engine API
